# LeagueOfLegends

This app requires an extra file, called riotApiKey.js, to be created in the root directory.  It should contain a single line:

```javascript
module.exports.riotApiKey =  '123apiKey' //replace with a valid riot api key
```


To run this app, run one of the following commands:

```shell
DEBUG=leagueoflegends:* npm start       #UNIX
set DEBUG=leageoflegends:* npm start    #DOS
```
