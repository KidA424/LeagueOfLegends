"# LeagueOfLegends" 

This app requires an extra file, called riotApiKey.js, to be created in the root directory.  It should contain a single line:

```javascript
module.exports.riotApiKey =  // a valid riot api key
>>>>>>> refs/remotes/origin/master
```


To run this app, run one of the following commands:

```shell
DEBUG=leagueoflegends:* npm start       #UNIX
set DEBUG=leageoflegends:* npm start    #DOS
```
